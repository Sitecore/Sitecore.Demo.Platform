        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What should I NOT bring with me to the hospital?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is recommended that you leave cash, credit cards and valuables at home.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">How do I get ready for surgery?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Screening and assessment should occur 2-3 weeks before your surgery whenever possible. You will be required to attend Total Joint class (make this a link to the power point slides) prior to your total joint replacement. You are encouraged to attend so that you can start your education and preparation for your upcoming surgery and recovery phase.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Will I need to receive a blood transfusion?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Sometimes after this type of surgery, a blood transfusion may be needed. Your blood counts will be monitored daily while you are in the hospital. Depending on the result and how you are responding with your therapy, the doctor may advise that you receive a blood transfusion. Whenever possible, arrangements can be made to have your own blood donated a few weeks before your planned surgery. Therefore, if you need a transfusion, your own blood can be given back to you. If not, you will receive blood issued from the American Red Cross Blood Bank. Remember, that all blood is thoroughly inspected and deemed safe before it is released.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">In order to decrease your potential for a blood transfusion, we ask that 1-4wks prior to your surgery that you begin taking an Iron Supplement (325mg twice a day with food).&nbsp; If you have active stomach ulcers or issues with nausea or cannot tolerate the Iron it is not required.&nbsp; Please make sure you are taking a stool softener while you are taking Iron- this can be constipating.&nbsp; Your pharmacist can help you find this over the counter.&nbsp; You can even purchase a stool softener and Iron supplement combined.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Will I have home-care services after discharge?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Depending on your recovery after surgery and insurance coverage, it will be determined what kind of home care services you may need. The physician, nurse therapist, Case Manager, and Home Care Coordinator will help with those decisions and arrangements.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What happens at the time of discharge from the hospital?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">For patients going home the day of surgery, expect to go home when your condition is stable.&nbsp; The amount of time will vary depending on the type of procedure and how you personally respond.&nbsp; Arrangements should be made prior for an adult to drive you home and stay with you the first night.&nbsp; Appropriate discharge instructions and necessary prescriptions will be given to you at the time of discharge.&nbsp; For patients staying one or more nights in the hospital, your doctor will tell you when you will be discharged and give any special instructions.&nbsp; On the day of discharge, you can anticipate the time to be mid to late morning.&nbsp; Appropriate discharge instructions will be given and discussed with you in full detail prior to your discharge from the hospital.&nbsp; Discharge instructions will include bathing instructions, medication (how much and when to take), how to manage pain, how and when to use special equipment, physical activity, resuming sexual relations, driving, returning to work, things to watch for and report to physician, wound care, and dressing changes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What about swelling, redness, bruising or drainage?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is normal to have some swelling after surgery. This gradually subsides but may be present for several days to weeks. Elevation and ice therapy will help to reduce swelling, and is strongly recommended.&nbsp; It is not unusual to have some redness around the wound and some clear, yellow or blood-tinged drainage. Bruising (black and blue) around the surgical site is common.&nbsp; Occasionally blisters may develop. They may open by themselves or we may open them in the office. If so, a dressing will be applied. Despite great care, any wound may become infected and for this reason the surgical site must be kept as clean as possible and the discharge dressing instructions must be followed. The signs of infection are increasing pain, a lot of drainage or pus coming from the wound, with redness and fever. If infection is suspected, please call the office or go to your nearest hospital or the emergency department.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What about driving or flying?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">As a general rule, you may return to driving once you are off pain medications and have regained your normal strength and reflexes.&nbsp; You must feel safe enough to drive that your ability wouldn't be questioned if an accident were to occur.&nbsp; It is illegal to drive if you have recently taken pain medications and these are circulating in your body.&nbsp; &nbsp;Air travel is allowed as soon as you feel capable. However, if you had a joint replacement you should not fly before 6 weeks because of the increased risk of blood clots.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">After knee replacement surgery, is it normal for my knee to look larger or be slightly warmer than my other knee which has not had knee replacement surgery?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is common for a post-operative knee to be larger or slightly warmer to the touch than the other knee that has not recently had joint replacement surgery. That is a very common feature and finding and is not necessarily related to the parts being a different size than the amount of bone that was resected. It is your body's natural response to surgery to have a little swelling and warmth for several months up to a year after surgery.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Is it normal to have numbness along the outer or lateral aspect of the incision?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is common to develop some numbness or change in sensation over the outer aspect of the knee after surgery. Incisions that are made directly over the front of the knee may cut across the sensory nerves to the outer aspect of your knee. Generally, after four to 6 months, much of the skin sensation will return. However, occasionally some permanent loss of sensation may be noted.</p>

Bruising (black and blue) around the surgical site is common.&nbsp; Occasionally blisters may develop. They may open by themselves or we may open them in the office. If so, a dressing will be applied. Despite great care, any wound may become infected and for this reason the surgical site must be kept as clean as possible and the discharge dressing instructions must be followed. The signs of infection are increasing pain, a lot of drainage or pus coming from the wound, with redness and fever. If infection is suspected, please call the office or go to your nearest hospital or the emergency department.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What about driving or flying?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">As a general rule, you may return to driving once you are off pain medications and have regained your normal strength and reflexes.&nbsp; You must feel safe enough to drive that your ability wouldn't be questioned if an accident were to occur.&nbsp; It is illegal to drive if you have recently taken pain medications and these are circulating in your body.&nbsp; &nbsp;Air travel is allowed as soon as you feel capable. However, if you had a joint replacement you should not fly before 6 weeks because of the increased risk of blood clots.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">After knee replacement surgery, is it normal for my knee to look larger or be slightly warmer than my other knee which has not had knee replacement surgery?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is common for a post-operative knee to be larger or slightly warmer to the touch than the other knee that has not recently had joint replacement surgery. That is a very common feature and finding and is not necessarily related to the parts being a different size than the amount of bone that was resected. It is your body's natural response to surgery to have a little swelling and warmth for several months up to a year after surgery.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Is it normal to have numbness along the outer or lateral aspect of the incision?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is common to develop some numbness or change in sensation over the outer aspect of the knee after surgery. Incisions that are made directly over the front of the knee may cut across the sensory nerves to the outer aspect of your knee. Generally, after four to 6 months, much of the skin sensation will return. However, occasionally some permanent loss of sensation may be noted.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What should I NOT bring with me to the hospital?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is recommended that you leave cash, credit cards and valuables at home.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">How do I get ready for surgery?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Screening and assessment should occur 2-3 weeks before your surgery whenever possible. You will be required to attend Total Joint class (make this a link to the power point slides) prior to your total joint replacement. You are encouraged to attend so that you can start your education and preparation for your upcoming surgery and recovery phase.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Will I need to receive a blood transfusion?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Sometimes after this type of surgery, a blood transfusion may be needed. Your blood counts will be monitored daily while you are in the hospital. Depending on the result and how you are responding with your therapy, the doctor may advise that you receive a blood transfusion. Whenever possible, arrangements can be made to have your own blood donated a few weeks before your planned surgery. Therefore, if you need a transfusion, your own blood can be given back to you. If not, you will receive blood issued from the American Red Cross Blood Bank. Remember, that all blood is thoroughly inspected and deemed safe before it is released.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">In order to decrease your potential for a blood transfusion, we ask that 1-4wks prior to your surgery that you begin taking an Iron Supplement (325mg twice a day with food).&nbsp; If you have active stomach ulcers or issues with nausea or cannot tolerate the Iron it is not required.&nbsp; Please make sure you are taking a stool softener while you are taking Iron- this can be constipating.&nbsp; Your pharmacist can help you find this over the counter.&nbsp; You can even purchase a stool softener and Iron supplement combined.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Will I have home-care services after discharge?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Depending on your recovery after surgery and insurance coverage, it will be determined what kind of home care services you may need. The physician, nurse therapist, Case Manager, and Home Care Coordinator will help with those decisions and arrangements.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What happens at the time of discharge from the hospital?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">For patients going home the day of surgery, expect to go home when your condition is stable.&nbsp; The amount of time will vary depending on the type of procedure and how you personally respond.&nbsp; Arrangements should be made prior for an adult to drive you home and stay with you the first night.&nbsp; Appropriate discharge instructions and necessary prescriptions will be given to you at the time of discharge.&nbsp; For patients staying one or more nights in the hospital, your doctor will tell you when you will be discharged and give any special instructions.&nbsp; On the day of discharge, you can anticipate the time to be mid to late morning.&nbsp; Appropriate discharge instructions will be given and discussed with you in full detail prior to your discharge from the hospital.&nbsp; Discharge instructions will include bathing instructions, medication (how much and when to take), how to manage pain, how and when to use special equipment, physical activity, resuming sexual relations, driving, returning to work, things to watch for and report to physician, wound care, and dressing changes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What about swelling, redness, bruising or drainage?</h2>

        <p style="margin: 0in;">For patients going home the day of surgery, expect to go home when your condition is stable.&nbsp; The amount of time will vary depending on the type of procedure and how you personally respond.&nbsp; Arrangements should be made prior for an adult to drive you home and stay with you the first night.&nbsp; Appropriate discharge instructions and necessary prescriptions will be given to you at the time of discharge.&nbsp; For patients staying one or more nights in the hospital, your doctor will tell you when you will be discharged and give any special instructions.&nbsp; On the day of discharge, you can anticipate the time to be mid to late morning.&nbsp; Appropriate discharge instructions will be given and discussed with you in full detail prior to your discharge from the hospital.&nbsp; Discharge instructions will include bathing instructions, medication (how much and when to take), how to manage pain, how and when to use special equipment, physical activity, resuming sexual relations, driving, returning to work, things to watch for and report to physician, wound care, and dressing changes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What about swelling, redness, bruising or drainage?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is normal to have some swelling after surgery. This gradually subsides but may be present for several days to weeks. Elevation and ice therapy will help to reduce swelling, and is strongly recommended.&nbsp; It is not unusual to have some redness around the wound and some clear, yellow or blood-tinged drainage. Bruising (black and blue) around the surgical site is common.&nbsp; Occasionally blisters may develop. They may open by themselves or we may open them in the office. If so, a dressing will be applied. Despite great care, any wound may become infected and for this reason the surgical site must be kept as clean as possible and the discharge dressing instructions must be followed. The signs of infection are increasing pain, a lot of drainage or pus coming from the wound, with redness and fever. If infection is suspected, please call the office or go to your nearest hospital or the emergency department.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What about driving or flying?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">As a general rule, you may return to driving once you are off pain medications and have regained your normal strength and reflexes.&nbsp; You must feel safe enough to drive that your ability wouldn't be questioned if an accident were to occur.&nbsp; It is illegal to drive if you have recently taken pain medications and these are circulating in your body.&nbsp; &nbsp;Air travel is allowed as soon as you feel capable. However, if you had a joint replacement you should not fly before 6 weeks because of the increased risk of blood clots.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">After knee replacement surgery, is it normal for my knee to look larger or be slightly warmer than my other knee which has not had knee replacement surgery?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is common for a post-operative knee to be larger or slightly warmer to the touch than the other knee that has not recently had joint replacement surgery. That is a very common feature and finding and is not necessarily related to the parts being a different size than the amount of bone that was resected. It is your body's natural response to surgery to have a little swelling and warmth for several months up to a year after surgery.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Is it normal to have numbness along the outer or lateral aspect of the incision?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is common to develop some numbness or change in sensation over the outer aspect of the knee after surgery. Incisions that are made directly over the front of the knee may cut across the sensory nerves to the outer aspect of your knee. Generally, after four to 6 months, much of the skin sensation will return. However, occasionally some permanent loss of sensation may be noted.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What should I NOT bring with me to the hospital?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">It is recommended that you leave cash, credit cards and valuables at home.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">How do I get ready for surgery?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Screening and assessment should occur 2-3 weeks before your surgery whenever possible. You will be required to attend Total Joint class (make this a link to the power point slides) prior to your total joint replacement. You are encouraged to attend so that you can start your education and preparation for your upcoming surgery and recovery phase.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Will I need to receive a blood transfusion?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Sometimes after this type of surgery, a blood transfusion may be needed. Your blood counts will be monitored daily while you are in the hospital. Depending on the result and how you are responding with your therapy, the doctor may advise that you receive a blood transfusion. Whenever possible, arrangements can be made to have your own blood donated a few weeks before your planned surgery. Therefore, if you need a transfusion, your own blood can be given back to you. If not, you will receive blood issued from the American Red Cross Blood Bank. Remember, that all blood is thoroughly inspected and deemed safe before it is released.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">In order to decrease your potential for a blood transfusion, we ask that 1-4wks prior to your surgery that you begin taking an Iron Supplement (325mg twice a day with food).&nbsp; If you have active stomach ulcers or issues with nausea or cannot tolerate the Iron it is not required.&nbsp; Please make sure you are taking a stool softener while you are taking Iron- this can be constipating.&nbsp; Your pharmacist can help you find this over the counter.&nbsp; You can even purchase a stool softener and Iron supplement combined.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">Will I have home-care services after discharge?</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">Depending on your recovery after surgery and insurance coverage, it will be determined what kind of home care services you may need. The physician, nurse therapist, Case Manager, and Home Care Coordinator will help with those decisions and arrangements.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2f5496; margin: 0in;">What happens at the time of discharge from the hospital?</h2>
