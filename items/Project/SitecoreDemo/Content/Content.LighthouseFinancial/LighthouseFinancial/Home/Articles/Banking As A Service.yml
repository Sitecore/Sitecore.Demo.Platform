        <h2>Digitization of Financial services</h2>
        <p>In times of turmoil, you go toward whom you trust.</p>
        <p>The coronavirus pandemic &mdash; which has forced all of us online &mdash; is exposing just who in financial services has embraced digitization, and who is truly digital native. We now must bank entirely online, by necessity. And many of us must transact entirely online, by necessity, to get the goods and services we need on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>The stage is being set, then, for consumers to pivot away from legacy banking toward trusted brands that, increasingly, are building out financial services. The space once reserved for marquee names like Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and peers is getting a bit crowded.</p>
        <p>In an interview with Karen Webster, Nigel Verdon, CEO of Railsbank, said the changing landscape of financial services has helped shine a light on the flexibility and speed companies need to develop new products and services and get them to market quickly to their end customers.</p>
        <p>The rise of open banking (and account aggregation) has shaped the conventional wisdom that banking will pivot toward innovation and service-oriented offerings.</p>
        <p>But, in truth, account aggregation is largely an activity that simply moves data from financial institution (FI) to FinTech.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s what you do with the data, and how you leverage it into new customer-facing offerings that matters.</p>
        <p>As Verdon told Webster, embracing platforms such as the one offered by Railsbank &mdash; which enables companies to issue unique international bank account numbers (IBANs), receive and send money and issue and manage cards &mdash; means that banking becomes a service rather than a series or suite of separate products.</p>
        <p>And, as Verdon explained, service-oriented platforms can spur a shift away from consumer banking with a bank &mdash; and toward individuals&rsquo; banking with whomever they trust.</p>
        <p>That functionality comes as Railsbank issues IBANs, by virtue of being connected to the Bank of England, among other partner banks, which then can be used to by firms to issue accounts and cards (in bank-like fashion).</p>
        <p>Along the way, Verdon said, firms can branch out into new offerings as they cater to end users&rsquo; demand.</p>
        <p>As Verdon said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not just financial services businesses going into these new use cases.&rdquo; There are a whole range of forward-thinking firms leveraging application programming interfaces (APIs) to issue cards, to create virtual accounts, promote micro-lending and micro-saving and even pay workers &mdash; all in bits and bytes.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supermarkets too,&rdquo; Verdon noted, drilling down into a vertical that might not be immediately synonymous with launching digital financial products.</p>
        <p>Against that backdrop, for example, the supermarket can enable workers to use Wagestream, an app backed in part by Bill Gates that lets employees get early access to wages, enabling them to manage cash flow more efficiently and avoid using payday lenders.</p>
