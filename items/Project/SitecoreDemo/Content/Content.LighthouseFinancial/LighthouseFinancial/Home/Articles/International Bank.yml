        <h2>An Uncertain Future</h2>
        A member of the Young Committee of 1929, which recommended the creation of a Bank for International Settlements, was asked what the Bank was going to do. "I don't know," he replied. "The important fact is that it exists. Unforeseen opportunities for service in the field of international finance will come to it as time unfolds. The conception is sound; the need is real; only the long future can answer your query."<br />
        <p>In some measure this reply holds good today, for the Bank's greatest possibility of usefulness still lies ahead. While its past has been active and fruitful, any continuous, constructive development was necessarily arrested by the outbreak, in the Bank's very infancy, of a world-wide financial crisis. This exercised a cramping effect upon international relations generally, and upon all organizations designed to facilitate them. Yet the six years that have elapsed since the Bank was opened have indicated the direction in is in flux.</p>
