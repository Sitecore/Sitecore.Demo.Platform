        <h2>Traditional Institutions Find Success</h2>
        Consumers are increasingly embracing platform-based businesses delivered on digital devices because they reduce friction, lower prices, and provide better service. On the flip side, seven of the 10 most valuable companies globally are now based on a platform business model, bringing together consumers and solution providers in marketplaces where they can interact and transact seamlessly.<br />
        <br />
        Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Netflix, and numerous others have further proven the great potential of platforms. Until recently, the word &ldquo;platform&rdquo; was only associated with such technology companies.<br />
        <p>One of the major benefits of a platform-based model is the ability to innovate through the combination of different businesses. There is also a faster speed-to-market component. While some firms may build a platform from the ground up, most will pursue a hybrid model, in which a traditional company supplements its existing business with a platform business for some activities and for market differentiation.</p>
        <p>The availability of affordable digital technologies enables companies of any size to embrace data, analytics, and a cloud-first approach to redesign traditional business models. One of the advantages of digital platforms is their ability to provide a &lsquo;pay-as-you-go&rsquo; business model that can combine traditional solutions with those from outside providers facilitated by application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
