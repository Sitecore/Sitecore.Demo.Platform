        <h2>Evolution of the System</h2>
        How has the international monetary system evolved over the last 75 years and how will it evolve in the future?<br />
        <h3>The Harvard View</h3>
        <p>The Harvard view is fundamentally empirical, although the regularities on which it focuses have stimulated some interesting theorizing. Its point of departure is the observation that some 60% of identified global foreign exchange reserves take the form of dollars, that more than 60% of the foreign currency liabilities and assets of banks are in dollars, and that the share of world trade invoiced in dollars far exceeds the United States&rsquo; share in global imports and exports.</p>
        <h3>The Berkeley View</h3>
        <p>If the Harvard view is fundamentally empirical, then the Berkeley view is fundamentally historical. It regards the dominance of the dollar for much of the last 75 years as a historical anomaly that is unlikely to persist. Eichengreen and Flandreau argue that multipolar international monetary arrangements have been the rule, not the exception. This was true before the gold standard, when silver, gold and bimetallic blocs coexisted and interacted. It was true in the 19th century, when the British pound, the French franc and the German mark all accounted for significant fractions of global foreign exchange reserves.</p>
        <p>It was true in the interwar period, for much of which sterling and the dollar contributed equally to the stock of global liquidity and were equally important as invoicing and settlement currencies. Historical evidence is not consistent, in particular, with the maintained assumption of the Harvard view that traded goods prices are sticky in terms of a single global currency. Indeed, international currency status was shared even in the last 75 years when the dollar rarely accounted for more than 70% of global foreign exchange reserves, trade invoicing, and payments through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) and for most of which it accounted for less.</p>
