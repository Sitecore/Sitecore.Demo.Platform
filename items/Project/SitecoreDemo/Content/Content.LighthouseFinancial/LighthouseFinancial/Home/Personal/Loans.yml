        <h2>Buying a home is a process. We can help.</h2>
        Navigating the financial side of buying a home can feel overwhelming. Habitat Financial is here to help you make an informed decision when evaluating the various home mortgage loan options. From finding out how much you can qualify for to applying for a mortgage loan and everything in between, we have your back!<br />
        <h3>What is a conventional fixed-rate mortgage?</h3>
        <p>A “fixed-rate” mortgage comes with an interest rate that won’t change for the life of your home loan. A “conventional” (conforming) mortgage is a loan that conforms to established guidelines for the size of the loan and your financial situation. Conventional loans may feature lower interest rates than jumbo loans, FHA loans or VA loans. Terms of these conventional loans typically range from 10 to 30 years.</p>
        <p>Monthly principal and interest payments on a conventional fixed-rate mortgage remain the same for the life of the loan making it an attractive option for borrowers who plan to stay in their home for several years. The alternative to the fixed-rate mortgage is the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which features lower monthly principle and interest payments during the first few years. While many prefer the security of a fixed-rate loan, an ARM may be a better option—especially if you know you’ll be moving within the next several years.</p>
        <h4>30-year fixed rate mortgages</h4>
        <p>The 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgage has long been popular due to its fixed interest rate and lower monthly payments. However, since the interest payments are spread out over 30 years, you’ll pay more interest over the life of the loan than you would on a shorter-term mortgage.</p>
        <h4>15- and 20-year fixed-rate mortgages</h4>
        <p>With a short loan term and lower interest rate, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage or 20-year fixed-rate mortgage can help you pay off your home faster and build equity more quickly, although your monthly payments will be higher than with a 30-year loan. The 15- and 20-year fixed-rate mortgages are especially popular for refinancing.</p>
        <h3>Conventional loan benefits and considerations</h3>
        <h4>No interest rate surprises</h4>
        <p>With a fixed-rate mortgage or a conventional loan, the interest rate won’t change for the life of your loan, protecting you from the possibility of rising interest rates.</p>
        <h4>The best fixed rate</h4>
        <p>Conventional mortgages may offer a lower interest rate and APR than other types of fixed-rate loans.</p>
        <h4>Fewer hoops to jump through</h4>
        <p>Conventional mortgages may require less documentation than FHA loans or VA loans, which could speed up the overall processing time.</p>
        <h4>Refinancing options available</h4>
        <p>Conventional fixed-rate mortgages are available for refinancing your existing mortgage, too—and 15- and 20-year options are especially popular.</p>
