        <h2>Benefits of Mobile Banking for Small Business</h2>
        There are plenty of advantages for businesses of all sizes to use the mobile banking options offered by your business bank. Today, you can add more payment options and get more done, using the device of your choice.<br />
        <h3>Deposit Checks</h3>
        <p>This payment option is perfect for businesses that have employees on the road. Service technicians can snap a picture of a customer check for instant deposit into your company account. Making paper check deposits using mobile banking technology moves more money through the business quickly, and lowers the cost of payment collection. Your business is paid when services or products are delivered, not net 30 days.</p>
        <h3>Conduct Credit and Debit Card Transactions</h3>
        <p>Both check deposits and credit and debit card transactions are called "Remote Payment Capture" or "Remote Deposit Capture." Payment using a credit or debit card simply requires a swipe and an electronic signature. Again, there&rsquo;s no more waiting for deposits. Payment is moved electronically from the customer&rsquo;s account to your company account faster.</p>
        <h3>Check Check Images</h3>
        <p>With just a click you can view images of paper checks that have been deposited and cleared to give you an accurate accounting of company balances. You can set up your remote payment and deposit system to view paper checks deposited by any of your employees, like the entire sales team, the service crew, or the managers manning the company booth at the trade show. You get the complete picture of what checks have been deposited and credited to your company account &ndash; anytime, anywhere.</p>
        <h3>Check Account Balances</h3>
        <p>Simply log on to your smart phone accounts dashboard to see a quick glance view of all company account balances. Need more detailed information? Virtually all company account information is stored securely by your bank, available for your review on your schedule. Another advantage of mobile banking? Bank on your schedule using your mobile phone. Boost productivity and get more done when you have the time to access the company books via mobile banking.</p>
        <h3>Review Your Transactions</h3>
        <p>On our mobile site, our transaction reviews are also greatly simplified &ndash; an advantage when you&rsquo;re out of the office. Review deposits and payments that have cleared and those that are pending. Approve payments from anywhere so they're always on time. Mobile banking simplifies company financials, whether making bill payments, or receiving payments from clients and customers.</p>
        <h3>Move Money Between Accounts</h3>
        <p>You&rsquo;re no longer tethered to a desktop computer. You don&rsquo;t need to find a Wi Fi hot spot for your laptop or tablet. With your mobile phone, you can access all your accounts and transfer funds between them on your terms. Keep more cash in interest-bearing accounts until the last minute.</p>
        <h3>Get Started with a Banking App</h3>
        <p>Using an app makes mobile banking even simpler. Ask your Small Business Banker how to download your bank&rsquo;s application. When you do, a bank icon will appear on your smart phone screen. Tap it, sign in, and get some banking business done. A banking application (app) enables you to conduct all your mobile banking faster and simpler, while collecting or making payments from anywhere within your service region.</p>
        <p>Whether you&rsquo;re a sole proprietorship or a global enterprise, now is a great time to get your company&rsquo;s banking mobilized and cut banking business down to size.</p>
