        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;">Schmidt Futures, in partnership with The Rhodes Trust, has announced the opening of applications for Rise, a new global talent program to find outstanding young people who need opportunity, and support them for life as they use their talents to build a better world. Rise is the anchor program of a broader&nbsp;$1 billion commitment&nbsp;from Eric and Wendy Schmidt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Rise seeks to identify talented young people, ages 15 to 17, from around the world who have the potential to use their talents to tackle the world's most pressing issues. The program will build a global community of rising leaders, connecting everyone who applies with peers around the world, free learning resources, and access to additional opportunities from the Rise network of partners. Additionally, each year, Rise will select 100 Global Winners and provide them with a lifetime of personalized support&mdash;including scholarships, mentorship, career services, and access to funding to develop their ideas&mdash;as they work together to serve others.&nbsp;Rise benefits could exceed $500,000 for every Global Winner over the course of their lifetime, depending on need, making this one of the largest scholarship programs&mdash;if not the largest&mdash;in the world.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Rise is working with dozens of global partners&mdash;from schools to businesses to local governments&mdash;to identify and support talented young people in communities throughout the world. Examples of these partnerships include United World Colleges, Teach For All, Global Citizen Year, African Leadership Group, AMIDEAST, National Youth Council Singapore, and the Latin American Leadership Academy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">I caught up with CEO Eric Braverman and Head of Strategy Cassie Crockett to find out more.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Afdhel Aziz: Eric and Cassie welcome. To start with, how would you articulate the purpose and vision of Schmidt Futures?&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Eric Braverman: Schmidt Futures bets early on exceptional people making the world better.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Co-founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt in 2017, we are a philanthropic initiative that creates public value from private philanthropy through risk transfer, investing where others can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t in people without a track record or with highly experimental ideas.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Our programs bring talent together into networks, bet on the most promising ideas through competition, and equip people to scale through partners and thoughtful application of modern tools from science and technology. In this sense we operate as a venture facility for public benefit.</p>
        <p class="color-body light-text" style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Eric Braverman, CEO of Schmidt Futures</p>
        <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #777777;">Adam Schultz @schultzinit http://schultz-media.net</span>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Aziz: Thanks for sharing that. Please tell us about the new Rise initiative and what that entails? Can you dimensionalize the incredible opportunity you are offering these 100 young people?</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Braverman: Rise aims to find exceptional young people who need opportunity and support them for life as they use their talents to serve others. A flagship program of Schmidt Futures and our second partnership with the Rhodes Trust, Rise is the anchor of Eric and Wendy Schmidt&rsquo;s $1 billion philanthropic commitment to support global talent.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">All around the world there are truly extraordinary people without a track record, with novel ideas, who don&rsquo;t look like the people supported before or who simply are not part of a system designed to find them.&nbsp;If we want to solve the world&rsquo;s biggest challenges, we have to have everyone at the table.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Cassie Crockett: Think about all the talent around the world we are leaving on the sidelines, for reasons of exclusion and bias, but also because of the lack of inclusion and opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">The first cohort of 100 Rise Global Winners will be announced in July 2021. These winners will attend a residential summit, receive need-based financial support for education and internships, receive mentorship and career services, and have access to funding to scale up their social impact throughout their careers, such as seed funding to start a social enterprise. However, many of the benefits, like free online instruction and access to our network of future opportunities are for all Rise applicants, not just the winners. Our goal is to build a global community.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="color-body light-text" style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Cassie Crockett, Head of Strategy at Schmidt Futures</p>
        <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #777777;">Schmidt Futures</span>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Aziz: You&rsquo;ve said ,&rdquo;It&rsquo;s all about the leverage that philanthropy has vs government or business&rdquo; - please say more about that, and why you are choosing to focus on young people?</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Braverman: We are living in a moment of great contrast. More people are living longer lives and at higher standards of living than ever before in human history. At the same time, the world has many challenges &mdash; from climate change, to growing economic disparity, to racial injustice, and more &mdash; all of which have been made worse by this terrible pandemic. Working in philanthropy, we are in a unique position to ask the question, &lsquo;how can we make the bets that equip people to do something about it?&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">We have to remember that most of the money to help people in the world sits within business and government.&nbsp;But in philanthropy we do not have the short-term earning pressures that keep often businesses from investing in promising ideas to help others &mdash; where the returns may take a long time to develop &mdash; and we can invest through political cycles and across administrations, making it easier for government to scale up ideas that others have already shown to work.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Crockett: If we look around the world today, it&rsquo;s clear that the next generation will need to rise up to tackle our greatest challenges. However, the young people in this next generation are facing significant setbacks in their education due to the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">At the same time, young people have access to these powerful new tools and technologies that allow them to connect, to share ideas, and to develop solutions to these problems in a way that was never possible before. By supporting hundreds of these ideas and solutions over the life of the program, not just a handful, we believe Rise has a better chance at creating a blueprint for building successful systems that serve communities in need.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Aziz: One thing that stood out to me is that this is not just about a one-off gift, but about staying with them throughout a period of time? Is it because some of these problems require sustained commitment?</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Braverman: These problems we are facing are not the type of problems that can be solved in a month, a year, or, for many, even a decade. These problems &mdash; like climate change, access to resources, education, healthcare, and so many others &mdash; will require creative, sustained effort over a lifetime. That&rsquo;s the reason why it can&rsquo;t be just a one-off gift. Our belief is if you want to be successful at betting on exceptional people, you have to look for talent early and everywhere, betting over and over again for a long time. Once is not enough.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Crockett: We know that at 15 years old, not everyone knows exactly how they will make a difference in their lifetime. But whenever they&rsquo;re ready to use their talents for good, we want to be there.</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Aziz: How does finding and helping people at inflection points in their careers help them better?</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Crockett: We know that the time between 15-17 years old is an absolutely critical time for young people to be getting that support. This is the height of their idealism, when they&rsquo;re on the cusp of adulthood &mdash; they are thinking about what the next step of their life might be. Rise gives these young people with ideas and dreams access to people, money, information, and systems needed to enact their vision in a serious manner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Braverman: We are excited about finding people at moments in their lives where a slight change in direction or support can have an outsized impact on their future &mdash; and ours.&nbsp;We named our initiative &lsquo;Schmidt Futures&rsquo; both because we want to empower people to make the future better for all of us, and also because people &mdash; even more than commodities &mdash; are the futures asset class worth betting on for the 21st century.</p>
        <p class="color-body light-text" style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Applications are open and accepted through January 29, 2021</p>

        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Aziz: Finally, where can people go to find out more and apply?</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Crockett: Whether you are a talented young person interested in applying, or want to nominate someone you think would be a good fit for Rise, www.risefortheworld.com is the place to find more information on the program online. We will be accepting applications through January 29, 2021.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Students can apply via Hello World, a mobile app developed in partnership with a new nonprofit chaired by Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy.&nbsp; For students who have little to no access to technology and connectivity, please visit the Rise website to learn more about applying through WhatsApp or on paper through select partners.</p>
