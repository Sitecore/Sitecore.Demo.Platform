# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

### Sitecore Version

Prior to attempting the demo installation, ensure you have a working **Sitecore XP 9.0.2** instance. Detailed installation instructions can be found at [doc.sitecore.com](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/90/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_90_Update2.aspx).

### Additional modules
In addition to a base XP 9.0.2 installation, the following modules are required:

- Sitecore PowerShell Extensions 4.7.2 for Sitecore 8/9 on [Marketplace](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/services/~/download/3D2CADDAB4A34CEFB1CFD3DD86D198D5.ashx?data=Sitecore%20PowerShell%20Extensions-4.7.2%20for%20Sitecore%208&itemId=6aaea046-83af-4ef1-ab91-87f5f9c1aa57)

### Optional Modules
Some gulp tasks have been included to help with repetitive tasks. These tasks require the SPE Remoting Module.

- SPE Remoting 4.7 [Marketplace](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/services/~/download/9624E65780594246A30FCB2F79770ECA.ashx?data=SPE%20Remoting-4.7&itemId=6aaea046-83af-4ef1-ab91-87f5f9c1aa57)
The "SPE" folder is assumed to be in the ~Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder 

*SECURITY WARNING* - The default configuration for the Habitat Home demo uses admin/b and allows this user to access SPE Remoting.

*IMPORTANT: Publish site after installing all required modules*

### Additional Windows Components
- Url Rewrite 2.1 
	- Can be installed using Web Platform Installer in IIS Manager
### SSL Only
The demo is configured for **HTTPS/SSL**. Please ensure that you create an HTTPS binding with appropriate self-signed certificates.

### Build / Deployment

In order to deploy the assets, you need either Visual Studio 2017 or MSBuild Tools for Visual Studio 2017.

Node.JS is also required



### Custom install - before you start

The following is a list of default values / assumptions for install locations

**Project location**		`c:\projects\sitecore.habitathome.content\`
**Habitat Site domain**				`habitathome.dev.local`
**Web Root**						`c:\inetpub\wwwroot`
**Host Suffix**						`dev.local`
**xConnectRoot** 	`habitat_xconnect.dev.local`


#### The hostname habitathome.dev.local is used in the SXA Hostname (Site Grouping). 

If you do not use habitathome.dev.local you will need to modify the Host Name in 
`/sitecore/content/Habitat Sites/Habitat Home/Settings/Site Grouping/Habitat Home` after successfully deploying the site.
The Habitat Home site will not respond / render correctly until this value is modified. 

If you do **not want to use the default settings**, you need to adjust the appropriate values in the following files:

`/gulp-config.js` 
`/publishsettings.targets` 
`src\Project\Common\code\App_Config\Include\Project\z.Common.Website.DevSettings.config`


## Installation:

All installation instructions assume using PowerShell 5.1 in administrative mode.

### 1. Clone this repository

#### Setting Git for Long Paths

- Before cloning, you need to configure git to allow long paths, which is not the default.

`git config --system core.longpaths true`

Clone the Sitecore.HabitatHome.Content repository locally - defaults are configured for **C:\Projects\Sitecore.HabitatHome.Content**. 


- Clone 
-- **https**:	`git clone https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Content.git` 
-- **ssh**:		`git clone git@github.com:Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Content.git`

### 2. Deploy Sitecore.HabitatHome.Content

From the root of the solution
- Run **`npm install`**

**if you plan on installing the Commerce (XC) demo:**
- Run **`.\node_modules\.bin\gulp quick-deploy`** 

if you are only installing this demo:
- Run **`.\node_modules\.bin\gulp`**

> An error (maxBuffer) sometimes occurs the first time running gulp during Sync-Unicorn. 
> Running gulp a second time resolves the issue (and doesn't take as long)

> if using **Visual Studio task runner**, please see [this workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45580456/visual-studio-task-runner-error-with-es6)
### 3. Validating deployment



1. Browse to https://habitathome.dev.local (or whatever hostname you selected)
	1. You should see the Habitat Home landing page with a full-width carousel
	2. If you do not see the full-width carousel and instead see the initial Sitecore default landing page, ensure that your Host Name was configured correctly in `/sitecore/content/Habitat Sites/Habitat Home/Settings/Site Grouping/Habitat Home`
1. Browse to https://habitat.dev.local
	1. You should see the Habitat landing page (not Habitat Home)


## Additional Settings
### 1. Disable Unicorn Serialization
When Unicorn is active, the Content Editor will display warnings that certain items are controlled by Unicorn. If you wish to disable Unicorn serialization, open the Web.config file in your webroot and update the following appSetting

    <add key="unicorn:define" value="Off"/>
This appSetting is `On` by default. Setting it to `Off` ensures that none of the Unicorn serialization configuration files are loaded.
