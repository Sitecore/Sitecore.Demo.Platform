        <h3>A New Focus for South Florida</h3>
        <p>&ldquo;South Florida has recently experienced a major inflow of hedge fund and private equity firms,&rdquo; said Bowman Brown, partner in the Miami office of Shutts and chairman of the firm&rsquo;s Financial Services Practice Group, via email.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;High tax rates in New York, Illinois, Connecticut, New Jersey and California have driven hedge fund and private equity firms to South Florida. The impact is enormous. Sophisticated financial professional&rsquo;s staff these entities and are moving in droves to South Florida with the firms that employ them. They are buying high-end houses and apartments, are focused on getting their kids into private schools, and are lining up to join country clubs. This will attract a substantial number of sophisticated financial professionals into the South Florida business community and will substantially increase economic activity here.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We are seeing more and more hedge fund activity coming to Florida from the Northeast due to the softer tax implications offered in the state of Florida,&rdquo; said Frank Gonzalez, principal-in-charge of MBAF&rsquo;s audit department and leader of the firm&rsquo;s Financial Institutions and SEC practices, via email. &ldquo;The incoming flow of these hedge funds has provided more business for financial services companies and accounting firms, as more and more financial advice and tax/accounting services are needed by these funds and for their customers. We are seeing more and more work being performed by financial institutions and accounting firms with hedge funds. This has been a very welcome situation for the Florida business market, as additional services are being provided. We are seeing an increase in specialized services that cater to dealing with hedge fund accounting, tax services and financial advice, including firms enhancing and promoting these niches at their firms.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The hedge fund arrival into Florida has definitely added high-paying job opportunities in that there are more specialized individuals needed to serve this industry and assist them with their services. I believe this has not only produced more higher-paying jobs for locals in the state of Florida but has also produced the relocation of people with hedge fund expertise to move to the area&rdquo; he said.</p>
