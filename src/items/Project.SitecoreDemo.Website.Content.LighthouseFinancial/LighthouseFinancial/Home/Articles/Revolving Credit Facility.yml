        <h2>A Unique Financial Instrument</h2>
        A RCF is a financing instrument that companies frequently recur to, particularly in syndicated format. For Investment-Grade (IG) companies, RCFs usually serve as backup instruments &ndash; a condition required by credit rating agencies to maintain their rating to issue bonds. That is why &lsquo;back-up&rsquo; RCFs are instruments set up not so much to draw down from them but by way of back-up line in case access to capital markets is compromised. When used, proceeds of this line are normally devoted to general corporate purposes. They are eminently relationship-driven transactions for banks, i.e. tools that grant access to another type of business with the borrowing companies.<br />
        <h3>Sustainable revolving credit line</h3>
        <p>In the last year many companies have arranged sustainable revolving credit lines with their relationship banks. Unlike other sustainable formats, the purpose of these lines is not to fund eco-friendly projects or investments, since these instruments are usually not set up to be drawn. A revolving credit facility is set up as sustainable, or converted to sustainable, by referencing its price to the sustainability-related performance of the company and, particularly, its evolution.</p>
        <p>In this type of operation, the interest rate paid on drawdowns is linked to the company&rsquo;s ESG (Environmental, Social and Good Governance ) score, or to one or more standout sector-specific indicators, or KPIs (such as CO2 emissions.) For the first time, a sustainable debt instrument may become cheaper if the borrower improves its ESG score with respect to the score awarded at the start and/or meets the specific reference KPIs selected for this funding.</p>
