        <h2>The Liquidity Challenge</h2>
        While challenges remain and will continue to persist for the coming months, banks such as DBS are providing digital solutions, as well as pragmatic advice to help companies and institutions manage their liquidity safely and efficiently across entities, borders and currencies.<br />
        <h3>A treasury view of the situation</h3>
        <p>While the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, it is also having enormous economic and business model ramifications. Governments globally, including Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as United States, United Kingdom and many European countries, have embarked on enormous fiscal programmes to stabilise their economies, and maintain confidence. Markets and economies remain extremely uncertain, particularly as conditions continue to change day by day, country by country, often at pace.</p>
        <p>Corporations in many sectors have experienced a collapse in demand, often before any reduction in costs materialise, while others have experienced a surge, both of which have liquidity implications. Seventy five percent of companies report disruption to supply chains. Failure of key suppliers, or their inability to deliver key components, severely impacts a company&rsquo;s manufacturing operations, and therefore their ability to meet customer demand and generate revenues.</p>
        <h3>Taking control of cash and liquidity</h3>
        <p>While individuals and families are advised to &lsquo;stay at home&rsquo;, for many businesses, cash is frequently not all at home, but held in accounts and currencies across Asia Pacific and beyond. Consequently, with conditions changing quickly, timely information, flexible liquidity and risk solutions and reliable advice have never been more important. In addition, outside normal conditions, such as working from home, accessing this is even more challenging than usual. A number of treasurers have reported difficulties in managing treasury processes and the attendant documentation and information flows which accompany them.</p>
        <p>In this environment, treasurers are relying on their trusted banking partners to help create certainty and deploy practical solutions. Managing liquidity is a core treasury priority that has now become even more pronounced; treasurers need to know how much cash they have, where it is, and how they can use it to meet fast-changing liquidity requirements across the business.</p>
