        <h2>Online Banking</h2>
        Below are a few ways you can benefit from online banking, by taking your finances into your own hands:<br />
        <h3>Convenient Access</h3>
        <p>9:00 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, no longer defines when you can and can&rsquo;t manage your account. Online banking makes it easy and efficient to manage your money online or through a mobile app. With Discover&rsquo;s mobile app, you can conveniently deposit checks, pay your bills, transfer money, and check your balance.</p>
        <h3>24 Hour Customer Service</h3>
        <p>Online banking doesn&rsquo;t mean you lose access to personal assistance. You can call, chat online, send an email, or post a question on the bank&rsquo;s social media sites. Discover, for example, offers 24/7 customer service. You have more ways to talk to people when you need them-without leaving your house.</p>
        <h3>Peace of Mind</h3>
        <p>Security is an important feature in online banking. Access is typically password protected and often secured by other identity confirmations, while encryption technology can be used to prevent unauthorized access to any of your personal data. When you bank online, you can track your account activity at your convenience and be the first to learn of any suspicious activity. Additionally, many online bank accounts, such as Discover accounts, are FDIC-insured up to the maximum allowed by law.</p>
