        <h2>Trends to be Aware</h2>
        These are some trends that financial advisers predict will happen this year, regarding Americans&rsquo; retirement savings:<br />
        <h3>More love for Roth accounts</h3>
        <p>The passing of the Secure Act may result in an increase of Roth accounts, said Sean Williams, a financial adviser at Sojourn Wealth Advisory in Timonium, Md. Part of the law eliminates &ldquo;stretch IRAs,&rdquo; which allowed individuals who inherited qualified accounts, like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans, to take required distributions over their lifespans.</p>
        <h3>Health Savings Accounts</h3>
        <p>Health Savings Accounts, or HSAs, are tax-advantageous accounts that allow workers to save, invest and withdraw their money tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses. They are also a beneficial tool for retirement savings.</p>
        <p>Contributing to an HSA, and not touching the money until retirement, by which time you&rsquo;ve amassed a large stockpile of savings, can be a solid retirement planning strategy, considering many medical expenses arise in retirement. The average 65-year-old couple retiring in 2019 could expect to spend $285,000 in retirement for health care costs alone, which does not include long-term care, according to Fidelity Investments.</p>
        <h3>Non-Traditional Retirement</h3>
        <p>The days of people working until they&rsquo;re 65 and then moving to a sunny state are long gone for many Americans, who will likely work well into their late 60s and early 70s, if even just part time, some advisers predict. Older workers staying in the workforce is increasingly common, and will continue in the future, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The number of workers 65 and older has tripled in the last 30 years, and those 75 and older has almost quadrupled during the same time.</p>
