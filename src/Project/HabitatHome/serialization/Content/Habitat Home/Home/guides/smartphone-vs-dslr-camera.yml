        <p>A real camera is going to take better photos and better videos. Yet there are many variables to take into consideration. Sometimes the weight and size of a camera can be prohibitive. For some people, the cost of buying a DSLR may be a barrier, but through their telephone carrier they can easily finance a high-end smartphone with a great camera.<br />
        <br />
        There are several reasons why someone could decide to choose one over the other. In this article we will explore the options to help you make the best decision. Here are the advantages of each:</p>
        <h2><strong>Advantages of Smartphones</strong></h2>
        <p>There are many reasons why some people prefer to shoot with a smartphone rather than a DSLR camera. Mostly this choice comes down to overall weight, as well as convenience. DSLRs sometimes feel like too much to carry around if you&rsquo;re not doing photography professionally. A smartphone is something you&rsquo;re likely to carry on you regularly and doesn&rsquo;t require any special accessories most of the time.<br />
        <br />
        With each new generation of smartphones adding more features, higher resolutions and expanding into high-quality video, there is an argument for the average person not needing a real camera.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Lightweight and fit in your pockets</li>
            <li>Uncomplicated and easy to use</li>
            <li>Images are immediately usable</li>

            <li>Small and unintimidating for models and small children</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advantages of a DSLR Camera</h2>
        <p>Whether you are shooting photography or video a DSLR camera is a powerful option. These cameras are enjoyed by enthusiasts and professionals for several reasons, including the ability to adapt the camera by using lenses and accessories to knowing that one has complete creative control of their image.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Interchangeable lenses give you more options</li>
            <li>Zoom lenses give you the ability to shoot further away</li>
            <li>Superior image quality overall</li>
            <li>The ability to have artistic control over the exposure</li>
            <li>More options for shooting in low light situations</li>
            <li>Better overall build quality (some are weatherproof)</li>
            <li>Larger image file-size capacity</li>
            <li>Higher resolution images and more detailed photos</li>
            <li>Better dynamic range and color accuracy</li>
            <li>The ability to create high depth of field with wide apertures</li>
            <li>Faster shutter speeds for shooting action or sports</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Which Camera Solution is Right for You?</h2>
        <p>The best camera is the one you have with you and the one that you know best. If you don&rsquo;t have the ability or the patience to use a DSLR camera you shouldn&rsquo;t feel pressured. There can be other valid options for you including point and shoot cameras or mirrorless cameras. It all comes down to user preference and your individual needs, not unlike the Mac versus PC computer argument.<br />
        <br />
        If you want to get shots in the moment and don&rsquo;t need them to be professional, then a smartphone is the convenient option. They are still capable of producing a level of quality that is more than acceptable for prints.<br />
        <br />
        When you are shooting photography or video professionally (that you&rsquo;re being paid for), you should most likely shoot on a DSLR camera. The interchangeable lenses and ability to shoot in low light situations will matter. This is particularly true if you are shooting portraits, need lens compression and distortion, or if you&rsquo;re filming events where lighting will be an issue.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts on Smartphones vs DSLR Cameras</h2>
        <p>As technology advances, there may come a time when smartphone cameras are truly competitive and offer the options and quality that allow them to replace a DSLR or Mirrorless Camera. For now, traditional cameras still produce superior quality and provide the versatility the professionals need in order to capture moments and create beautiful imagery. For the everyday consumer, a smartphone packs more than enough pixels and features to be fun and affordable.</p>

        <p>This question may seem fairly easy to answer on the surface. A real camera is going to take better photos and better videos. Yet there are many variables to take into consideration. Sometimes the weight and size of a camera can be prohibitive. For some people, the cost of buying a DSLR may be a barrier, but through their telephone carrier they can easily finance a high-end smartphone with a great camera.<br />
        <br />
        There are several reasons why someone could decide to choose one over the other. In this article we will explore the options to help you make the best decision. Here are the advantages of each:</p>
        <h2><strong>Advantages of Smartphones</strong></h2>
        <p>There are many reasons why some people prefer to shoot with a smartphone rather than a DSLR camera. Mostly this choice comes down to overall weight, as well as convenience. DSLRs sometimes feel like too much to carry around if you&rsquo;re not doing photography professionally. A smartphone is something you&rsquo;re likely to carry on you regularly and doesn&rsquo;t require any special accessories most of the time.<br />
        <br />
        With each new generation of smartphones adding more features, higher resolutions and expanding into high-quality video, there is an argument for the average person not needing a real camera.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Lightweight and fit in your pockets</li>
            <li>Uncomplicated and easy to use</li>
            <li>Images are immediately usable</li>
            <li>Apps in the phone allow for easy editing</li>
            <li>Pictures can immediately be shared online</li>
            <li>Capable of easily shooting slow-mo and time-lapse</li>
            <li>Create easy panorama images without complex editing</li>
            <li>Small and unintimidating for models and small children</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advantages of a DSLR Camera</h2>
        <p>Whether you are shooting photography or video a DSLR camera is a powerful option. These cameras are enjoyed by enthusiasts and professionals for several reasons, including the ability to adapt the camera by using lenses and accessories to knowing that one has complete creative control of their image.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Interchangeable lenses give you more options</li>
            <li>Zoom lenses give you the ability to shoot further away</li>
            <li>Superior image quality overall</li>
            <li>The ability to have artistic control over the exposure</li>
            <li>More options for shooting in low light situations</li>
            <li>Better overall build quality (some are weatherproof)</li>
            <li>Larger image file-size capacity</li>
            <li>Higher resolution images and more detailed photos</li>
            <li>Better dynamic range and color accuracy</li>
            <li>The ability to create high depth of field with wide apertures</li>
            <li>Faster shutter speeds for shooting action or sports</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Which Camera Solution is Right for You?</h2>
        <p>The best camera is the one you have with you and the one that you know best. If you don&rsquo;t have the ability or the patience to use a DSLR camera you shouldn&rsquo;t feel pressured. There can be other valid options for you including point and shoot cameras or mirrorless cameras. It all comes down to user preference and your individual needs, not unlike the Mac versus PC computer argument.<br />
        <br />
        If you want to get shots in the moment and don&rsquo;t need them to be professional, then a smartphone is the convenient option. They are still capable of producing a level of quality that is more than acceptable for prints.<br />
        <br />
        When you are shooting photography or video professionally (that you&rsquo;re being paid for), you should most likely shoot on a DSLR camera. The interchangeable lenses and ability to shoot in low light situations will matter. This is particularly true if you are shooting portraits, need lens compression and distortion, or if you&rsquo;re filming events where lighting will be an issue.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts on Smartphones vs DSLR Cameras</h2>
        <p>As technology advances, there may come a time when smartphone cameras are truly competitive and offer the options and quality that allow them to replace a DSLR or Mirrorless Camera. For now, traditional cameras still produce superior quality and provide the versatility the professionals need in order to capture moments and create beautiful imagery. For the everyday consumer, a smartphone packs more than enough pixels and features to be fun and affordable.</p>
