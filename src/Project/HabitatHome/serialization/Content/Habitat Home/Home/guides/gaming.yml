        <p>Dedicated PC gamers need a dedicated gaming room. The ideal gaming environment combines comfort, convenience, and technology, with room for a few mood-setting accessories.</p>
        <p>To help you map out your gaming room and outfit it with high-quality audio and video equipment, Habitat's community of avid PC gamers came up with this list of essentials. Play on&hellip;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Choose the right room</strong></p>
            <p>Much like a home theater, a dedicated gaming room should be protected from outside light and sound. A basement is ideal, but a spare bedroom will suffice. That said, your ideal gaming room should be large enough to accommodate a wide flat-screen TV or projection screen, a speaker system, and seating for yourself and a few friends. Because game nights can get loud, make sure the room also has adequate soundproofing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Choose your TV monitor</strong></p>
            <p>The bigger the screen, the more real-life your gaming experience. Habitat offers an extensive inventory of flat-screen TVs that range from 45 to 100 inches. You can also choose from HDR and LED lighting to the latest 4K Ultra HD. Habitat's Dynamix line includes HDTV, UHD, and 4K LED Ultra HD technology. </p>
            <p>If you want an extra-large screen and a theater-like experience, invest in a projection system. Habitat's projection screens start at 100 inches. If you go this route, make sure you have the space to accommodate a large screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Consider a gaming PC</strong></p>
            <p>Dedicated gaming PCs have even faster multicore processors than standard desktop computers. They also have specialized 3D graphics cards so you can view and interact with virtual worlds. Additional features range from Plexiglas case doors and special cooling setups. Habitat's gaming PCs offer 1080-pixel HD or 4K displays to put you in the scene with or without a VR headset. You can also pair the computer with any number of Habitat LED-lit or HDTV monitors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Console and accessories</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone has a favorite&mdash;Microsoft Xbox, Sony PS, Nintendo Wii and Wii U, or Habitat NextCube (You know which one we'd pick!). </p>
            <p>Depending on how you like to play, you may also want to invest in extra controllers and/or VR headsets. The Habitat NextCube-Wireless Game Controller has extra-comfortable grips to keep you playing for hours. Wireless connectivity gives you more range and allows you to connect to other NextCube game consoles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Modifications</strong></p>
            <p>A high-end gaming PC may not be practical for a lot of people, and that&rsquo;s partly because PC parts can be expensive. More importantly, there are many different interpretations on what "high-end" actually means. Habitat Home's high-end PC experts recommend a build aimed at a price tier of around $2,000 / &pound;2,000, but we're not afraid to go a bit higher if we feel it's justified. We'll also provide some easy downgrades if you're looking to trim things down.<br />
            <br />
            If you'd rather have more RAM rather than higher performance RAM, be prepared for a much larger increase in price&mdash;and the benefits of 32GB are only available if you're actually running workloads that need more than 16GB. There's no binary right/wrong answer to the question of speed vs. capacity, but most users will see more benefit from faster RAM, at least once we're at the 16GB level.</p>

            <p><strong>Join the Community</strong></p>
            <p>Look for a small, tight knit PC gaming community that allows you to login and play fun, stress free games with mature people from all over the world. Some of the best communities pull together people to play games like Overwatch, Rainbow Six: Siege, PU: Battlegrounds, Rocket League, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Battlefield, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Minecraft and more.</p>

        <p>Les joueurs de jeux vidéos sur PC ont besoin d'une salle de jeu dédiée. L'environnement de jeu idéal combine le confort, la commodité et la technologie, avec de la place pour quelques accessoires pour bien raccorder le tout.</p>
        <p>Pour vous aider à planifier votre salle de jeu et à l'équiper d'équipement audio et vidéo de haute qualité, la communauté de joueurs de PC avides de Habitat Home a dressé cette liste d'articles essentiels. Toujours jouer…</p>

            <p><strong>Choisir la bonne salle</strong></p>
            <p>Tout comme un cinéma-maison, une salle de jeux dédiée devrait être protégée de la lumière et des sons extérieurs. Un sous-sol est idéal, mais une chambre d'amis suffira. Cela dit, votre salle de jeu idéale devrait être assez grande pour accueillir un grand téléviseur à écran plat ou un écran projecteur, un système de haut-parleurs et des sièges pour vous et quelques amis. Parce que les soirées de jeux peuvent être bruyantes, assurez-vous que la pièce est également insonorisée. </p>

        <p>Dedicated PC gamers need a dedicated gaming room. The ideal gaming environment combines comfort, convenience, and technology, with room for a few mood-setting accessories.</p>
        <p>To help you map out your gaming room and outfit it with high-quality audio and video equipment, Habitat's community of avid PC gamers came up with this list of essentials. Play on&hellip;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Choose the right room</strong></p>
            <p>Much like a home theater, a dedicated gaming room should be protected from outside light and sound. A basement is ideal, but a spare bedroom will suffice. That said, your ideal gaming room should be large enough to accommodate a wide flat-screen TV or projection screen, a speaker system, and seating for yourself and a few friends. Because game nights can get loud, make sure the room also has adequate soundproofing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Choose your TV monitor</strong></p>
            <p>The bigger the screen, the more real-life your gaming experience. Habitat offers an extensive inventory of flat-screen TVs that range from 45 to 100 inches. You can also choose from HDR and LED lighting to the latest 4K Ultra HD. Habitat's Dynamix line includes HDTV, UHD, and 4K LED Ultra HD technology. </p>
            <p>If you want an extra-large screen and a theater-like experience, invest in a projection system. Habitat's projection screens start at 100 inches. If you go this route, make sure you have the space to accommodate a large screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Consider a gaming PC</strong></p>
            <p>Dedicated gaming PCs have even faster multicore processors than standard desktop computers. They also have specialized 3D graphics cards so you can view and interact with virtual worlds. Additional features range from Plexiglas case doors and special cooling setups. Habitat's gaming PCs offer 1080-pixel HD or 4K displays to put you in the scene with or without a VR headset. You can also pair the computer with any number of Habitat LED-lit or HDTV monitors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Console and accessories</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone has a favorite&mdash;Microsoft Xbox, Sony PS, Nintendo Wii and Wii U, or Habitat NextCube (You know which one we'd pick!). </p>
            <p>Depending on how you like to play, you may also want to invest in extra controllers and/or VR headsets. The Habitat NextCube-Wireless Game Controller has extra-comfortable grips to keep you playing for hours. Wireless connectivity gives you more range and allows you to connect to other NextCube game consoles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Modifications</strong></p>
            <p>A high-end gaming PC may not be practical for a lot of people, and that&rsquo;s partly because PC parts can be expensive. More importantly, there are many different interpretations on what "high-end" actually means. Habitat Home's high-end PC experts recommend a build aimed at a price tier of around $2,000 / &pound;2,000, but we're not afraid to go a bit higher if we feel it's justified. We'll also provide some easy downgrades if you're looking to trim things down.<br />
            <br />
            If you'd rather have more RAM rather than higher performance RAM, be prepared for a much larger increase in price&mdash;and the benefits of 32GB are only available if you're actually running workloads that need more than 16GB. There's no binary right/wrong answer to the question of speed vs. capacity, but most users will see more benefit from faster RAM, at least once we're at the 16GB level.</p>

            <p><strong>Join the Community</strong></p>
            <p>Look for a small, tight knit PC gaming community that allows you to login and play fun, stress free games with mature people from all over the world. Some of the best communities pull together people to play games like Overwatch, Rainbow Six: Siege, PU: Battlegrounds, Rocket League, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Battlefield, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Minecraft and more.</p>
