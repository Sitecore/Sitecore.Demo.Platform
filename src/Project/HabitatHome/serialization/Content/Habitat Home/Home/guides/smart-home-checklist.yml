        <div>What if all the devices in your life could connect to the Internet? Not just computers and smartphones, but everything: clocks, speakers, lights, doorbells, cameras, windows, window blinds, hot water heaters, appliances, cooking utensils, you name it. And what if those devices could all communicate, send you information, and take your commands? It's not science fiction; it's the Internet of Things (IoT), and it's a key component of home automation and smart homes.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Home automation is exactly what it sounds like: automating the ability to control items around the house—from window shades to pet feeders—with a simple push of a button (or a voice command). Some activities, like setting up a lamp to turn on and off at your whim, are simple and relatively inexpensive. Others, like advanced surveillance cameras, may require a more serious investment of time and money.</div>
        <p>There are a plethora of different accessories that work only with certain products, and some work better than others. Here's a guide to help you sort through the jumble and become acclimated to your first voice-controlled smart home.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Choose an Assistant</strong></p>
        <p>Virtual voice-controlled assistants like Apple&rsquo;s Siri, Google&rsquo;s Assistant and Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa make it easy to control smart home products by speaking simple commands. Each of these tools has its strengths and weaknesses, so choose the one that will be more likely to work for your needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: Select a Location</strong></p>
        <p>One other thing you'll want to think about as you bring a smart assistant into your home is where you're going to put it. You can use your smart assistant anywhere you like, so long as it's in range of your home's Wi-Fi signal and a power outlet. Whether that means you put it in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, or living room is up to you, and the choice really depends on how you're planning on using it.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: Put Your Assistant to Work</strong></p>
        <p>This is where the fun begins. With your virtual assistant, you can set up your home a number of ways to make it &ldquo;smarter.&rdquo; You can set your assistant to work with other smart devices or outlets. This will give you the ability to control your lights, fans, thermostat, speakers, locks, and much more.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: Fine Tune Your Devices</strong></p>
        <p>You can improve your smart home setup as you go by making tweaks to your devices and the way you keep them organized. Depending on the device, you can modify the settings for optimal livability on a daily basis. This kind of fine-tuning can help guide you through a gradual expansion of your setup. Start small, get comfortable with how your smart assistant works, and then build outwards, bit by bit. It won't take long for your smart home to take shape.</p>

        <div>What if all the devices in your life could connect to the Internet? Not just computers and smartphones, but everything: clocks, speakers, lights, doorbells, cameras, windows, window blinds, hot water heaters, appliances, cooking utensils, you name it. And what if those devices could all communicate, send you information, and take your commands? It's not science fiction; it's the Internet of Things (IoT), and it's a key component of home automation and smart homes.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Home automation is exactly what it sounds like: automating the ability to control items around the house—from window shades to pet feeders—with a simple push of a button (or a voice command). Some activities, like setting up a lamp to turn on and off at your whim, are simple and relatively inexpensive. Others, like advanced surveillance cameras, may require a more serious investment of time and money.</div>
        <p>There are a plethora of different accessories that work only with certain products, and some work better than others. Here's a guide to help you sort through the jumble and become acclimated to your first voice-controlled smart home.</p>
